    "- Rules of the Game\n",
    "  - There are two types of ship: the Patrol and the Cruiser. The Patrol occupies a single cell, the Cruiser occupies two cells, horizontally or vertically.\n",
    "  - Three Patrols and three Cruisers will be placed randomly in the grid, without ships adjacent in rows and columns (in particular, two adjacent cells can   - only both be ship cells if they belong to the same Cruiser).\n",
    "  - The player calls six different cells, trying to guess if there's a Patrol or a Cruiser in it.\n",
    "  - Hits and misses are recorded on the board. For every hit Patrol or Cruiser, a point is gained, and if a Cruiser is sunk, two additional points are gained.\n",

    "- guesses is a list containing 6 strings which are the coordinates of the guesses made by the player.\n",
    "- What do you have to implement?\n",
    "- The Tests will expect each instance of the Battleship class to possess four methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- board() will return the final state of the board, based on the placement of the ships and the results of the player guesses, as a matrix of size 5x5. - To vizually represent the state of the game, you will use four different characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ' ' = a blank space on the board.\n",
    "  - 's' = a space occupied by a ship.\n",
    "  - '.' = a miss (wrong guess).\n",
    "  - 'X' = a hit (a correct guess).\n",
    "  - hits() will return the total number of hits made by the player (correct guesses), either on Patrols or on Cruisers.\n",
